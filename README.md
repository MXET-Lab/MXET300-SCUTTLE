# MXET-300 Lab SCUTTLE Repository

This repository is tailor suited with software and document files geared toward the MXET-300 Mobile Robotics lab utilizing the SCUTTLE Platform, forked from the original SCUTTLE Robot repository. For additional documentation and resources from the original repository, please visit [scuttlerobot/SCUTTLE](https://github.com/scuttlerobot/SCUTTLE) and the [SCUTTLEâ„¢ Webpage](https://scuttlerobot.org).

SCUTTLE (Sensing, Connected, Utility Transport Taxi for Level Environments) is a low-cost, open source mobile robot with robust utility in a variety of applications.

Please note that some hardware modifications were made from the original SCUTTLE robot design to suit the need of the MXET-300 lab and increase utility as well as user experience. These hardware changes will be made available at a later time.

Please also note that some previous software may have been modified from the original and that some software has also been added to suit the need of the MXET-300 lab.
