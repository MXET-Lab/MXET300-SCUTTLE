## Wishlist for Beaglebone Blue upgrades by the SCUTTLE team:
#### STATUS: (re-collecting input from previous document as of 07.20)

### Performance Requests
* Charging of 3 cell LiPo batteries
* Servos must be able to be run from battery OR plugin power independently
* Keep at least 2 motor outputs based on PRU for high frequency


### Hardware Requests
* keeping 2 wifi signals is great
* Reverse polarity protection
* 12v motor outputs
* 5gHz is low priority (to date)
* gold plated pins for motors and servos to support current
* interested in QWIIC connectors in JST-SH locations
* countermeasure the motor output pins plastic cowling - they slide off
* GPIO accessable PWM outputs [#313](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/issues/313#issuecomment-513881299)
* More GPIO inputs [#313](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/issues/313)
* Seperate PWM's from UARTs [#313](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/issues/313)
*
