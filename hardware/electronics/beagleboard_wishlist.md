## Wishlist for Beaglebone Blue upgrades by the SCUTTLE team:
#### STATUS: (re-collecting input from previous document as of 07.20)

### Performance related
* charging of 3 cell LiPo batteries
* servos must be able to be run from battery OR plugin power independently
* keep at least 2 motor outputs based on PRU for high frequency


### Hardware related
* keeping 2 wifi signals is great
* 5gHz is low priority (to date)
* gold plated pins for motors and servos to support current
* interested in QWIIC connectors in JST-SH locations
* countermeasure the motor output pins plastic cowling - they slide off
